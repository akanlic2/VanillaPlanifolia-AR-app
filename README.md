# Vanilla Planifolia – AR Application

## 📱 Project Overview

Vanilla Planifolia is a mobile Augmented Reality (AR) application developed using Unity, designed to provide an interactive and educational experience focused on the vanilla plant and its applications.

The application allows users to explore vanilla through AR-based 3D objects, multimedia content, and an integrated quiz, combining learning with immersive interaction.

This project was developed as an academic project, demonstrating the practical use of AR technologies, multimedia integration, and mobile user interaction.


## 🎯 Purpose of the Application

The main goals of this application are:
- To present educational content using Augmented Reality
- To demonstrate image-based AR tracking on mobile devices
- To combine 3D models, audio, and video content in Unity
- To assess user knowledge through an interactive quiz

Users are encouraged to carefully observe the AR content, as the information presented is later used in the quiz section.


## 🧩 Application Features

### Main Menu
- Navigation to the AR scene and Quiz
- Sound feedback on button interaction

### AR Scene
- Image-based AR tracking
- Interactive 3D objects related to vanilla:
  - Perfume – plays a sound effect and displays a product description
  - Ice Cream – plays an educational video
  - Vanilla Extract Bottle – plays a video showing the extract production process
- Information panel with usage instructions
- Optimized lighting for AR environments (no real-time shadows)

### Quiz Section
- 10 multiple-choice questions
- Questions based on previously displayed AR and video content
- Visual feedback for correct and incorrect answers
- Sound effects for answer selection
- Final score display with retry option


## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Unity Engine
- C#
- Vuforia SDK (Image-based AR tracking)
- Unity UI and TextMeshPro
- Git and GitHub
- Git LFS (Large media file management)
- Android Build Target


## 📁 Project Structure

The repository includes only essential project files:

- Assets – scenes, scripts, models, materials, videos, audio
- Packages – Unity package dependencies
- ProjectSettings – Unity project configuration

Generated folders such as Library, Logs, and build outputs are excluded using .gitignore.
